  "description": "Question Set is your typical quiz content type. It allows the learner to solve a sequence of various question types. You can combine many different question types like Multichoice, Drag and drop and Fill in the blanks in a Question set. As an author there are many settings you can use to make it behave just the way you want it to. You may for instance customize the Question set with background images and define a pass percentage for the learner. The Question Set also allows you to add videos that are played at the end. One video for success, another if the learner fails the test. This might motivate learners to try again if they fail so that they get to see the success video."
